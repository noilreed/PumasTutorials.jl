### Learning Outcome

  * To fit a full TMDD model with data from only ligand, ligand and target, target and ligand-target complex
  * Write a differential equation for a full TMDD model

### Objective

  * The objective of this exericse is to fit the data to a TMDD model

### Dosage Regimen

  * Single dose of 1.5 mg/kg was administered as IV-Bolus at `time=0`
  * Single dose of 5 mg/kg was administered as IV-Bolus at `time=0`
  * Single dose of 15 mg/kg was administered as IV-Bolus at `time=0`
  * Single dose of 45 mg/kg was administered as IV-Bolus at `time=0`

```julia
dose = [1.5, 5, 15, 45]
dose_ind(x) = DosageRegimen(dose[x], time=0, cmt=1)

pop4_sub = map(i -> Subject(id=i, events=dose_ind(i)), 1:4)
```

### Simulation

We will simulate the full model and specific time points to be scattered on the data

```julia; results="hidden"
Random.seed!(123)
sim_pop4 = simobs(pk_27, pop4_sub, param, obstimes=0.1:1:500)
df1      = DataFrame(sim_pop4)
```

### Dataframe and Plot

Convert the simulation to a dataframe and make necessary plots using dataframe

```julia
df1_dv = filter( x -> x.time in [0.1,1.1,10.1,24.1,72.1,120.1,168.1,240.1,360.1,499.1], df1)
