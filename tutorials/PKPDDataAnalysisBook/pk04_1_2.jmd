```julia; echo = false
using Dates
```

### Background

  * Structural model        - One compartment linear elimination with first order absorption.
  * Route of administration - Oral, Multiple dosing
  * Dosage Regimen          - 352.3 μg
  * Number of Subjects      - 1

### Learning Outcome

This is a one compartment multiple oral dosing model. In the exercise pk04,
 four models are compared.

 * Model 1 - One compartment model without lag-time, **distinct parameters Ka and K**
 * Model 2 - One compartment model with lag time, **distinct parameters Ka and K**
 * Model 3 - One compartment model without lag time, **Ka = K = K¹**
 * Model 4 - One compartment model with lag time, **Ka = K = K¹**

### Objectives

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build one compartment model for
 multiple oral dosing and to simulate the model for a single subject.

### Libraries

call the "necessary" libraries to get start.

```julia
using Pumas
using Plots
using CSV
using StatsPlots
using Random
```

### Model 1 & 2

In this one compartment model, we administer multiple doses orally.

```julia
pk_04_1_2    = @model begin
  @param begin
    tvka     ∈ RealDomain(lower=0)
    tvk      ∈ RealDomain(lower=0)
    tvvc     ∈ RealDomain(lower=0)
    tvlag    ∈ RealDomain(lower=0)
    Ω        ∈ PDiagDomain(3)
    σ²_prop  ∈ RealDomain(lower=0)
  end

  @random begin
    η        ~ MvNormal(Ω)
  end

  @pre begin
    Ka       = tvka * exp(η[1])
    K        = tvk * exp(η[2])
    Vc       = tvvc * exp(η[3])
    lags     = (Depot = tvlag,)
  end

  @dynamics begin
    Depot'   = -Ka*Depot
    Central' =  Ka*Depot - K*Central
  end

  @derived begin
    cp       = @. Central/Vc
    dv       ~ @. Normal(cp, sqrt(cp^2*σ²_prop))
  end
end
```

### Parameters

The parameters are as given below. `tv` represents the typical value for parameters.

  * Ka - Absorption Rate Constant (hr⁻¹),
  * K  - Elimination Rate Constant (hr⁻¹),
  * Vc - Volume of Central Compartment(L),
  * Ω - Between Subject Variability,
  * σ - Residual error


```julia
param1 = (tvka    = 0.14,
          tvk     = 0.14,
          tvvc    = 56.6,
          tvlag   = 0,
          Ω       = Diagonal([0.0,0.0,0.0]),
          σ²_prop = 0.015)
```

```julia
param2 = (tvka    = 0.20,
          tvk     = 0.12,
          tvvc    = 64.9,
          tvlag   = 0.70,
          Ω       = Diagonal([0.0,0.0,0.0]),
          σ²_prop = 0.01)
```

### Dosage Regimen

Subject received 352.3 μg of oral dose once a day for 10 days.

```julia; results="hidden"
ev1  = DosageRegimen(352.3, time=0, ii=24, addl=9, cmt=1)
sub1 = Subject(id=1, events=ev1)
sub2 = Subject(id=2, events=ev1)
```

### Simulation

Simulation the plasma concentration of the drug after multiple oral dosing

```julia; results="hidden"
## Model 1 - without lag time
Random.seed!(123)
sim_sub1 = simobs(pk_04_1_2,sub1,param1,obstimes= 0:0.1:240)
df1      = DataFrame(sim_sub1)

## Model 2 - with lag time
Random.seed!(123)
sim_sub2 = simobs(pk_04_1_2,sub2,param2,obstimes= 0:0.1:240)
df2      = DataFrame(sim_sub2)
```

### Plots

```julia
df2_dv = filter(x -> x.time in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,14,24,216,216.5,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,226,228,230,240], df2)

@df df1 plot(:time, :cp,
              xlabel = "Time (hr)", ylabel = "Concentration (ug/L)", label = "Pred-Without lag-time",
              title = "Plasma Concentration vs Time", linewidth = 3, legend=:outerright,
              xticks = [0,24,48,72,96,120,144,168,192,216,240], ylims=(0,3.0))
@df df2 plot!(:time, :cp, label = "Pred-With lag-time", linewidth=3)
@df df2_dv scatter!(:time, :dv, label="Obs-Conc")
```

```julia; echo=false, eval=false
par2 = (tvka    = 0.20,
        tvk     = 0.12,
        tvvc    = 64.9,
        tvlag   = 0.70,
        Ω       = Diagonal([0.0225,0.048,0.0962]),
        σ²_prop = 0.019)

ev1  = DosageRegimen(352.3, time=0, ii=24, addl=9, cmt=1)
pop  = map(i -> Subject(id=1,events=ev1), 1:40)

Random.seed!(1234)
sim_pop = simobs(pk_04_1_2,pop,par2,obstimes=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,14,24,216,216.5,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,226,228,230,240])

CSV.write("./data/generated/pk04_1.csv", df_sim)
